# Medical Student Experience Implementation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the medical student experience implementation for the Murph Next.js project. It details the key features, architecture, and implementation approach for the medical student dashboard, availability management, and consultation workflow.

## Architecture Overview

The medical student experience is built on the following architecture:

- **Next.js App Router**: Path-based routing with `/medical-student/*` routes
- **React Components**: Specialized components in the `/components/medical-student` directory
- **Custom Hooks**: Medical student-specific hooks for data management
- **Context Providers**: Shared authentication and internationalization contexts
- **Mock Data**: JSON-based mock data for demonstration purposes

## Key Routes

- `/medical-student/dashboard`: Main dashboard with statistics and consultation overview
- `/medical-student/availability`: Availability management interface
- `/medical-student/consultations`: Consultation listing with filtering
- `/medical-student/consultations/:id`: Detailed consultation view
- `/medical-student/profile`: Profile management with expertise settings

## User Flow

1. Medical student logs in through the authentication flow
2. Upon successful login, the user is redirected to the dashboard
3. From the dashboard, the medical student can:
   - View statistics and upcoming consultations
   - Accept or decline new consultation requests
   - Access ongoing consultations
   - Manage availability settings

- Equipment verification for video/audio channels

## Consultation Management

The consultation management interface provides tools for handling the entire consultation lifecycle:

### 1. Tab-Based Filter Navigation

- Available: New consultation requests matching expertise and availability
- Assigned: Active consultations that have been accepted
- Scheduled: Consultations with a specific scheduled time
- In-Progress: Ongoing consultations that have started
- Completed: Historical record of past consultations

### 2. Consultation Listing

Each consultation in the list displays:

- Patient name and basic information
- Consultation type and primary concern
- Status with color-coding
- Scheduled date/time if applicable
- Quick action buttons appropriate to the status
- Last activity timestamp

The list supports filtering by date range, type, status, and search by patient name or concern.

### 3. Accept/Decline Flow

When accepting a consultation, the medical student can:

- Select a specific time slot from their availability
- Propose alternative times if needed
- Add a personal message to the patient
- Set expectations for the consultation duration
- Flag if additional information is needed

When declining, the system requires:

- Selecting a reason for declining
- Optional suggestion for a better-matched medical student
- Optional message to the patient

### 4. Detailed Consultation View

The detailed view of a consultation includes:

- Complete patient information
- All submitted documents with preview capability
- Full consultation history with timestamps
- Private notes section for medical student's reference
- Action buttons appropriate to the current status
- Communication channel controls
- Document sharing capabilities

### 5. Consultation Notes

A specialized note-taking interface for medical students:

- Free-text notes area
- Structured template options for common scenarios
- Save draft and finalize options
- Time-stamped entry system
- Option to include references to medical resources
- Private notes that are not shared with the patient

## Profile and Expertise Management

The profile management interface allows medical students to update their information and expertise:

### 1. Basic Profile Information

The expertise configuration directly affects which consultations are offered to the medical student.

## Component Structure

The medical student experience is built using the following main components:

- `MedicalStudentDashboard`: Main dashboard component with statistics and consultation overview
- `AvailabilityManager`: Weekly schedule configuration component
- `ExpertiseConfiguration`: Consultation type and expertise settings
- `ConsultationList`: Filterable list of consultations
- `ConsultationCard`: Individual consultation display with context-sensitive actions
- `ConsultationDetail`: Full detailed view of a single consultation
- `WeeklySchedule`: Calendar-based schedule display and editor
- `MedicalStudentProfile`: Profile details and settings

Each of these components is composed of smaller, reusable UI components from the core component library.

## Internationalization

All components support both German and English through the internationalization system:

- Text content is loaded from language-specific message files
- Date and time formatting follows locale-specific conventions
- German medical terminology is accurately translated
- UI adapts to text length differences between languages

## Responsive Design

The medical student interface is fully responsive:

- **Desktop**: Multi-column layout with side panels and expanded information
- **Tablet**: Adapted layouts with collapsible sections and prioritized content
- **Mobile**: Streamlined interface with progressive disclosure and focused workflows

The design maintains usability across all device sizes while ensuring that critical actions remain accessible.

## Data Flow

The medical student experience uses the following data flow pattern:

1. Authentication determines the user's role and ID
2. Custom hooks load relevant data from mock JSON (future API)
3. Component state manages UI interactions and temporary data
4. State updates flow to child components through props
5. Actions trigger state updates and would make API calls in the full implementation

## Mock Data Integration

The implementation uses the following mock data structures:

- Medical student profiles with expertise information
- Availability settings with weekly patterns
- Consultation requests with patient information
- Patient profiles with basic information
- Medical documents with mock content

## Future Enhancements
