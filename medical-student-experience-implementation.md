## Architecture Overview

The medical student experience is built on the following architecture:

- **Next.js App Router**: Path-based routing with `/medical-student/*` routes
- **React Components**: Specialized components in the `/components/medical-student` directory
- **Custom Hooks**: Medical student-specific hooks for data management
- **Context Providers**: Shared authentication and internationalization contexts
- **Mock Data**: JSON-based mock data for demonstration purposes

## Key Routes

- `/medical-student/dashboard`: Main dashboard with statistics and consultation overview
- `/medical-student/availability`: Availability management interface
- `/medical-student/consultations`: Consultation listing with filtering
- `/medical-student/consultations/:id`: Detailed consultation view
- `/medical-student/profile`: Profile management with expertise settings

## User Flow

1. Medical student logs in through the authentication flow
2. Upon successful login, the user is redirected to the dashboard
3. From the dashboard, the medical student can:
   - View statistics and upcoming consultations
   - Accept or decline new consultation requests
   - Access ongoing consultations
   - Manage availability settings
   - Update profile and expertise information

## Dashboard Implementation

The medical student dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the medical student's activity and pending tasks. It includes:

### 1. Statistics Section

- **Consultations Completed**: Total count of completed consultations
- **Patient Satisfaction**: Average rating from patients
- **Ongoing Consultations**: Count of current active consultations
- **Available Hours**: Summary of weekly availability

Each statistic is displayed with changes compared to the previous period, providing trends at a glance.

### 2. Available Consultations

This section displays new consultation requests that match the medical student's expertise and availability:

- Each consultation card shows:
  - Consultation type (lab results, medication, etc.)
  - Patient's primary concern
  - Requested communication channel
  - Preferred time frame
  - Accept/Decline buttons with independent loading states

The accept action opens a confirmation dialog with scheduling options, while decline requires a reason for tracking purposes.

### 3. Assigned Consultations

This section shows consultations that the medical student has accepted but not yet completed:

- Sorting options by date, urgency, or type
- Status indicators (scheduled, in-progress, awaiting patient)
- Quick action buttons to continue each consultation
- Clickable cards for accessing detailed view

### 4. Weekly Availability Preview

A condensed view of the student's current availability schedule:

- Visual calendar showing available time blocks

- Indicator for upcoming consultation slots
- Conflict warnings if availability doesn't match scheduled consultations

### 5. Quick Actions

Prominently displayed action buttons for common tasks:

- Update availability
- Review pending consultations

- Clear day/week options

The interface uses a visual grid layout with drag-to-select functionality for desktop and tap-to-toggle for mobile.

### 2. Specific Date Management

- Calendar picker for selecting specific dates
- Exclusion dates for vacations or unavailable days
- Special availability for specific dates that override the weekly pattern
- Bulk selection for setting multiple dates at once

### 3. Consultation Type Preferences

Medical students can indicate their expertise levels for different consultation types:

- Expertise rating for each consultation type (beginner to expert)
- Toggle to enable/disable specific consultation types
- Maximum consultations per day/week settings
- Specialization tags for matching algorithm

### 4. Communication Preferences

Settings for preferred communication channels:

- Video call availability and preferences
- Audio call availability and preferences
- Text chat availability and preferences

- Equipment verification for video/audio channels

## Consultation Management

The consultation management interface provides tools for handling the entire consultation lifecycle:

### 1. Tab-Based Filter Navigation

- Available: New consultation requests matching expertise and availability
- Assigned: Active consultations that have been accepted
- Scheduled: Consultations with a specific scheduled time
- In-Progress: Ongoing consultations that have started
- Completed: Historical record of past consultations

### 2. Consultation Listing

Each consultation in the list displays:

- Patient name and basic information
- Consultation type and primary concern
- Status with color-coding
- Scheduled date/time if applicable
- Quick action buttons appropriate to the status
- Last activity timestamp

The list supports filtering by date range, type, status, and search by patient name or concern.

## Component Structure

The medical student experience is built using the following main components:

- `MedicalStudentDashboard`: Main dashboard component with statistics and consultation overview
- `AvailabilityManager`: Weekly schedule configuration component
- `ExpertiseConfiguration`: Consultation type and expertise settings
- `ConsultationList`: Filterable list of consultations
- `ConsultationRequestCard`: Individual consultation display with context-sensitive actions
- `ConsultationDetail`: Full detailed view of a single consultation
- `WeeklyScheduleEditor`: Calendar-based schedule display and editor
- `MedicalStudentProfile`: Profile details and settings

Each of these components is composed of smaller, reusable UI components from the core component library.

## Internationalization

All components support both German and English through the internationalization system:

- Text content is loaded from language-specific message files
- Date and time formatting follows locale-specific conventions
- German medical terminology is accurately translated
- UI adapts to text length differences between languages

## Responsive Design

The medical student interface is fully responsive:
