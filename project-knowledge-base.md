# Murph Project Knowledge Base

## Core Project Files

- `project-overview.md`: High-level project description, goals, and vision
- `agent-roles.md`: Each agent's responsibilities and collaboration points
- `technical-specifications.md`: Technical requirements and architecture
- `ui-design-guidelines.md`: Design principles, color schemes, and components
- `content-guidelines.md`: Mock data structure and content requirements
- `development-workflow.md`: Development process and collaboration patterns
- `deployment-guide.md`: Vercel deployment process and feedback collection

## Knowledge Exchange Workflow

1. **GitHub Repository**: All markdown files are maintained in the GitHub repository
2. **Claude Knowledge Base**: GitHub repository is imported into Claude's project knowledge base
3. **Agent Access**: Each agent directly references documents in the knowledge base by name
4. **Automatic Knowledge Updates**: After completing tasks, agents provide updated markdown files
5. **Synchronization**: Updated files are pushed to GitHub and automatically synchronized with Claude's knowledge base
6. **Context Sharing**: All agents access the same knowledge base documents for consistency
