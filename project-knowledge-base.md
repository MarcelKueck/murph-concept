# Murph Project Knowledge Base

## Core Project Files

- `project-overview.md`: High-level project description, goals, and vision
- `agent-roles.md`: Each agent's responsibilities and collaboration points
- `technical-specifications.md`: Technical requirements and architecture
- `ui-design-guidelines.md`: Design principles, color schemes, and components
- `content-guidelines.md`: Mock data structure and content requirements
- `development-workflow.md`: Development process and collaboration patterns
- `deployment-guide.md`: Vercel deployment process and feedback collection
- `project-timeline.md`: Detailed timeline with tasks, milestones, and dependencies
- `landing-page-design.md`: Detailed specifications for landing page layout and animations

## Knowledge Exchange Workflow

1. **GitHub Repository**: All markdown files are maintained in the GitHub repository
2. **Claude Knowledge Base**: GitHub repository is imported into Claude's project knowledge base
3. **Agent Access**: Each agent directly references documents in the knowledge base by name
4. **Automatic Knowledge Updates**: After completing tasks, agents provide updated markdown files
5. **Synchronization**: Updated files are pushed to GitHub and automatically synchronized with Claude's knowledge base
6. **Context Sharing**: All agents access the same knowledge base documents for consistency

## Internationalization Enhancement Needs

During implementation, we identified some missing translation keys that need to be added to both English and German language files:

1. Document type translations (labResult, prescription, imaging, etc.)
2. Document management placeholders and instructions
3. Consultation status and filtering labels
4. Profile page section headings and form labels

These translation keys need to be added to ensure a fully localized experience across all new patient functionality.
